Hi, I'm Erfan.

I work mostly with Python and computer vision–related projects.  
I care a lot about writing code that is clean, understandable, and easy to reuse.

Lately, I've been focusing on face image processing and quality estimation pipelines, especially around preprocessing, embeddings, and evaluation logic. I like projects where I can take something research-like and turn it into a practical tool.

### What I usually work with
- Python
- - PyTorch
- NumPy / Pandas
- OpenCV
- Git
- Html & Css
- JavaScript
- C++
- linux/unix


I’m always trying to improve how I structure projects and explain what they do — both in code and documentation.
